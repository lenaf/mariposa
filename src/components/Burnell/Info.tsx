    <div className="mb-4">"The main aspects of art are invisible; the basic nature of art is invisible. The essence of visual art is not seen. The unseen nature of art, and the development of its aspects, reduces thought to all sorts of speculation. The discussion of science is scientific; the discussion of art is superstitious. There is no history. </div>
    <div className="mb-4">What are its dimensions? Is it on a flat plane? Do the mediums recline on the surface or are they perched upon it? Is each medium itself evenly balanced? If the surface is not level, does the tilted plane give rise to a secondary stratum of materials? Is the painting itself symmetrical? If not, does it face outwards or inwards relative to the tilted plane? Does the paint spread from a focal point at the centre towards the peripheral edges? Ostensibly, the contours and drama crescendo at the periphery, however I hesitate to fully commit to this observation. How would I describe the shape of the outermost layer of this mountain-like form - is it pointed, rounded, or flat? Very well - this rigid, rock-shaped silicone and resin alchemical invention is a dense stroke running parallel to the surface plane. And then as I move to the side, it evaporates. In what manner is it seemingly disappearing? More broadly, how do the materials establish this ‘spatial’ environment encompassing the sculpture-painting? When two surfaces proximate, they delineate an area between; separated far enough, the area ceases to be an area. Only a void persists."</div>
